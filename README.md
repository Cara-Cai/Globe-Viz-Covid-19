# Globe-Viz-Covid-19

This project is a 3D Globe visualization of country-wide COVID-19 total cases and total deaths from 2020-01-22 to 2023-03-09.

Considering the GPU capacity and performance of computers, some countries are not indicated on the globe. They are not forgotten. There's an extra table for them.

The framework and geoJson file used is from the [Globe GL module](https://github.com/vasturiano/globe.gl). The dataset used is [parsed data](https://github.com/EP-Visual-Design/COVID-19-parsed-data/tree/main) by John Henry Thompson, whose data source is [CSSE at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master). The full project documentation can be accessed [Here](https://pastoral-galliform-f42.notion.site/Documentation-of-Globe-Viz-7ff04b815f3e4d99b3e5d4e9a543a913).

For clarification, the height of the country polygons is mapped based on the total cases of the countries.

This project is contributed to [The Covid Impact Project](https://covid19impactproject.com/) by John Henry Thompson & Shindy Johnson.
